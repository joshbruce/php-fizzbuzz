# Procedural Fizz buzz

When I think of procedural programming I think literal line-for-line execution in the global scope and only using basic language features.

I appreciate differentiating a function from a method where a function exists in the global scope and a method is a function defined within the scope of a class.

With that said, if I define a function, in my estimation, I start moving away from the procedural paradigm.

This one should be interesting because I've never tried to write automated tests for a purely procedural program.
