# Functional Fizz buzz

Functional programming has a lot of characteristics I appreciate.

1. Immutable state.
2. No variable assignment.
3. Pure functions: No side-effects.

`functions.php` stores the I/O portion while `function-defs.php` holds all the defined functions to make it work.

Any function prefixed with `func` is defined by me, specifically for this implementation while those without `func` are standard PHP functions.

I appreciate the functional style a great deal, mainly because of the concepts of immutable state and it seems to enforce the concept of dependency injection.

From a design principles perspective it also lends itself to Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and the Single Point of Truth (SPOT) concepts.
